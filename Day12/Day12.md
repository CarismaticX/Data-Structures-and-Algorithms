### 📅 Date: 31 July 2025

### ✍️ Overview  
First day of travel — not an ideal setup for deep work, but I still managed to make the most of it. Will be reaching the destination tomorrow, so I’ve still got some time to stay productive on the way.

---

### 📘 What I Did  
- Revisited core DSA topics like Arrays and Binary Search through notes and saved screenshots.  
- Watched 1–2 Love Babbar videos offline (thankful I downloaded them earlier!).  
- Did some light mental dry runs of sorting and searching algorithms — surprisingly helpful.

---

### 💭 Thoughts  
- Travel days are tiring, but it felt good to squeeze in some learning.  
- Staying in touch with the routine, even a little, makes a big difference.  
- Happy that I didn’t let travel completely throw me off track.

---

### 🔄 Tomorrow  
- Continue with concept revision during the rest of the journey.  
- Attempt the LeetCode daily challenge if the network allows.  
- Reach destination and maybe get a little coding done if energy and time permit.
