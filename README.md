# üß† My DSA Journey (C++)

This repository documents my progress learning Data Structures & Algorithms using C++. It includes day-wise solved problems and concepts learned.

üìÖ **Started:** 20 July 2025  

---

## üìå Structure
- Day-wise folders  
- Each folder contains C++ files with solved problems

---

## üìä Current Status
- Reached **Day 102 / 150** in the DSA Challenge.  
- Currently **paused due to end-semester exams and health recovery**.  
- Plan to **resume soon at a slower pace**, focusing on  
  - deeper conceptual understanding,  
  - more hands-on practice, and  
  - consistency over speed.
