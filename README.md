# 🧠 My DSA Journey (C++)

This repository documents my progress learning Data Structures & Algorithms using C++. It includes day-wise solved problems and concepts learned.

📅 **Started**: 20 July 2025

## 📌 Structure
- Day-wise folders
- Each folder contains C++ files with solved problems

## ✅ Topics Covered
- Arrays (Basics, Search, Sum, Min/Max)
- Time & Space Complexity (Big O Notation)
- Binary Search (Basic & Variations)

## 📅 Weekly Progress

### Week 1 (20 July 2025 – 26 July 2025)
- ✅ Learned C++ syntax essentials (loops, functions)
- ✅ Practiced pattern printing problems
- ✅ Started with array basics: search, sum, min/max
- ✅ Solved problems on LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks

### Week 2 (27 July 2025 – 2 August 2025)
- ✅ Learned Time & Space Complexity
- ✅ Studied Binary Search and its variations
- ✅ Solved key Binary Search problems:
  - Search in Rotated Sorted Array
  - Book Allocation
  - Painters Partition
  - Aggressive Cows
  - Square Root (Binary Search approach)
- ✅ Practiced number systems, math logic, and array basics
- ✅ Continued solving problems on LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks

## 🛠️ Resources
- Mainly following **Love Babbar’s DSA Playlist**
- Occasionally referring to **Striver’s explanations**
- Practicing problems from **LeetCode** & **GeeksforGeeks**
